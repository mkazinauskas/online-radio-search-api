                <h1>2. The Service.</h1>
                <p><b>a. Description.</b> TuneIn provides an information location tool and audio guide service offering access to a selection of indexed radio stations, podcasts, and other content, including radio stations, podcasts and other content created by or on behalf of TuneIn. Certain features of the Service are available to you free of charge (the “<b>Free Service</b>”). Other aspects of the service, currently referred to as “TuneIn Premium,” are only available to paying subscribers (the “<b>Subscriptions</b>”). Any end user who access and uses the Free Service is a “<b>Visitor,</b>” and any end user who pays for a subscription is a “<b>Subscriber</b>.”  The term “<b>Users</b>” refers to Visitors and Subscribers, collectively.</p>
                <p><b>b. Consideration.</b></p>
                <p class="indent"><b>i. Service.</b> You acknowledge and agree that this EULA is entered into in consideration of your use of the Service pursuant to this EULA and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which you acknowledge.</p>
                <p class="indent"><b>ii. Subscriptions.</b> If you are a Subscriber, then you acknowledge and agree that the additional terms in Section 4 below apply to your Subscriptions, and that TuneIn provides access to Subscriptions in consideration of your payment of the amounts described in that Section.  </p>
                <p class="indent"><b>iii. No Rights to Compensation.</b> In return for enjoying the Free Service or Subscriptions, you further acknowledge and agree that TuneIn may generate revenues (including from advertising and sponsorships), increase goodwill or otherwise increase the value of TuneIn from your use of the Service, and you will have no right to share in any such revenue, goodwill or value whatsoever.</p>
                <p><b>c. Changes to the Service.</b> TuneIn may at its sole discretion and from time to time change, add or remove features, functionality and content of or available through the Service without any notice to you. TuneIn may also terminate or discontinue support for any versions of the App, whether it was offered for free or for a fee. TuneIn also reserves the right to discontinue some or all of the features of the Service at any time at its sole discretion (including the provision of software updates and support for different devices or platforms). You acknowledge and agree that TuneIn will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service, any App, or any specific functionality of the Service or the removal of any features, functionality or content. If you are dissatisfied with any changes to the Service, then your sole option is to discontinue or terminate your use of the Service as described herein. Notwithstanding anything in this EULA to the contrary, if you have signed up for a Subscription and TuneIn cancels your Subscription without cause, then TuneIn will refund to you the pro-rated (by month), unearned portion of any amounts that you have prepaid to TuneIn for such Subscription.  No refunds will be provided for the termination or discontinuance of support for any paid App.</p>
                <p><b>d. Mobile Services.</b> The Service is currently accessible via computer or on a mobile phone, tablet or other connected device (collectively, “<b>Mobile Services</b>”). Your mobile carrier’s or ISPs normal messaging, data and other rates and fees will apply to your use of the Mobile Services. In addition, downloading, installing or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your mobile carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. Therefore, you are solely responsible for checking with your mobile carrier to determine if the Mobile Services are available for your mobile device(s), what restrictions, if any, may be applicable to your use of the Mobile Services, and how much they will cost you. Nevertheless, all use of the App and the related Mobile Services must be in accordance with this EULA.</p>
                <p><b>e. Service Security.</b> You may not violate, or attempt to violate, the security of the Service. Any such violations may result in criminal and/or civil penalties against you, as well as the termination of your privilege to use the Service. TuneIn reserves the right to investigate any alleged or suspected violations and, if a criminal violation is suspected, to refer such suspected violation to the appropriate law enforcement agencies and cooperate fully with such investigations. This cooperation may include the disclosure of all or your activities on or related to the Service. You agree to promptly notify TuneIn if you learn or reasonably suspect that any security breach related to the Service has occurred.</p>

                <h1>4. Additional Terms for Subscription. </h1>
                <p><b>a. Subscription Process.</b> You may purchase a Subscription through the Website, through our App, or through such other channels as TuneIn may make available from time-to-time in its sole discretion. Where you purchase a Subscription through the Website or another channel controlled by TuneIn, your payments are processed by our third party payment processors. Where you purchase a Subscription through our iOS or Android Apps or through a third party’s consumer electronic devices, your payments are processed by Apple or Google, or the manufacturer of the consumer electronic device (or any of their third party payment processors), as applicable. We accept various forms of payment, as specified during sign-up. We do not accept cash or checks. </p>
                <p><b>b. Trials.</b> From time to time, TuneIn or others on our behalf may offer trials of Subscriptions for a specified period free-of-charge or at a reduced rate (“<b>Trial</b>”). The length of any Trial may vary. Trials are for new and certain former Subscribers only. TuneIn reserves the right, at our discretion, to determine your eligibility for a Trial, and, subject to applicable laws, to withdraw or to modify a Trial at any time without prior notice and with no liability, to the greatest extent permitted under the law. We will require you to provide your payment details at the start of the Trial. The first day following the end of your Trial or, if you are not eligible for a Trial, then the day you purchase your Subscription, is the first day of your billing cycle (“<b>Billing Date</b>”). YOU will BE automatically charged for the applicable Subscription on the first day following the end of the Trial, on a recurring monthly or annual basis, unless you cancel the applicable Subscription before the end of the Trial. </p>
                <p><b>c. Billing Authorization.</b> BY PROVIDING YOUR PAYMENT METHOD AND OBTAINING A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE, YOU AUTHORIZE TUNEIN, APPLE, OR GOOGLE (OR ANY OF THEIR SERVICE PROVIDERS), AS APPLICABLE, TO CHARGE TO YOUR DESIGNATED PAYMENT METHOD THE APPLICABLE MONTHLY OR ANNUALLY RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION FEES (“<b>SUBSCRIPTION FEE</b>”), AND ANY APPLICABLE SALES, TELECOMMUNICATION, EXCISE, VALUED-ADDED OR SIMILAR TAXES (“<b>TAXES</b>”). THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS EXCLUSIVE OF ANY SUCH TAXES. THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE IS PAYABLE IN THE CURRENCY SPECIFIED DURING SIGN-UP. </p>
                <p><b>d. Subscription Fee Changes.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE AT ANY TIME IN OUR SOLE DISCRETION. IF WE CHANGE THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE, THEN WE WILL PROVIDE YOU NOTICE OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE AT LEAST 30 DAYS BEFORE THE CHANGE IS TO TAKE EFFECT. SUBSCRIPTION FEE CHANGES WILL TAKE EFFECT AT THE START OF THE NEXT RENEWAL OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION FOLLOWING THE DATE OF THE PRICE CHANGE. YOU ACCEPT THE NEW PRICE BY CONTINUING TO USE THE SERVICE AFTER THE PRICE CHANGE TAKES EFFECT. IF YOU DO NOT ACCEPT THE PRICE CHANGE, THEN YOU MAY UNSUBSCRIBE FROM THE SERVICE PRIOR TO THE PRICE CHANGE GOING INTO EFFECT.</p>
                <p><b>e. Automatic Renewal.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, BY PURCHASING A SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE THAT YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW AT THE END OF EACH SUBSCRIPTION TERM AT THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE AND FOR THE SAME TERM AS THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING SUBSCRIPTION, UNLESS AND UNTIL YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION. </p>
                <p><b>f. Recurring Charges.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, UPON EXPIRATION OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WILL AUTOMATICALLY BE BILLED FOR THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION PLAN (OR THE MOST SIMILAR SUBSCRIPTION PLAN, IF YOUR PRIOR PLAN IS NO LONGER AVAILABLE) AT THE THEN-CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION FEE PLUS ANY TAXES. YOUR PAYMENT METHOD WILL BE CHARGED THE SUBSCRIPTION FEE FOR THE RENEWAL TERM OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION ON YOUR BILLING DATE, BASED ON THE TYPE OF SUBSCRIPTION (E.G., ON A PARTICULAR DATE EACH MONTH FOR A MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION). IF, HOWEVER, THE BILLING DATE OF YOUR SUBSCRIPTION IS ON THE 29TH, 30TH OR 31ST DAY OF A MONTH, AND YOUR BILLING DATE DOES NOT EXIST IN A PARTICULAR MONTH BECAUSE THERE ARE FEWER THAN THIRTY-ONE (31) DAYS IN THE MONTH PAYMENT IS DUE, THEN YOUR BILLING DATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR RENEWAL WILL BE ON THE LAST DAY OF THE MONTH IN WHICH YOUR BILLING DATE WOULD OTHERWISE BE. </p>
                <p><b>g. Cancellation and Refunds.</b> YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION TO THE SERVICE AT ANY TIME BY FOLLOWING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED <a href="https://help.tunein.com/how-do-i-unsubscribe-from-tunein-premium-Bkgbg5R5dPf">HERE</a>. IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, THEN YOU WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SUBSCRIPTION UNTIL THE DATE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN YOUR NEXT BILLING DATE, AFTER WHICH YOU WILL BE DOWNGRADED TO THE FREE SERVICE. IF YOU SUBSCRIBED THROUGH YOUR IOS OR ANDROID DEVICE AND WANT TO OBTAIN A REFUND IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, THEN YOU MUST CONTACT APPLE OR GOOGLE, AS APPLICABLE. IF YOU SUBSCRIBED THROUGH THE WEBSITE, THEN SUBJECT TO SECTION 4.h BELOW, WE WILL NOT REFUND ANY FEES PAID FOR YOUR CURRENT SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD.</p>
                <p><b>h. Cooling-off Period.</b> If you reside in the European Union (or any other jurisdiction that requires a cooling-off period following the purchase of a Subscription to the Service) and register for a Subscription, then you may cancel your Subscription for any reason or no reason and receive a full refund of your Subscription Fee within 14 days of your payment method being charged (“<b>Cooling-off Period</b>”) unless you have previously accessed your Subscription (i.e., you receive a transmission through the Service). If you have accessed the Service following the date of charge of your payment method pursuant to your Subscription at any time during the Cooling-off Period, however, then we will not refund any Subscription Fees already paid to us.</p>
                <p><b>i. Failure to Pay.</b> If you fail to pay the applicable Subscription Fee when due, then you will be downgraded to the Free Service. If you are downgraded, then TuneIn may, but is not obligated to, maintain your Account and/or related content and information, in order to allow you to pay the past-due charges and restore your Subscription.</p>

                <h1>10. Dispute Resolution.</h1>
                <p><b>a. General.</b> In the interest of resolving disputes between you and TuneIn in the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and TuneIn agree that any dispute arising out of or in any way related to this EULA or your use of the Service will be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is less formal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. This agreement to arbitrate disputes includes all claims arising out of or in any way related to this EULA or your use of the Service, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory, and regardless of whether a claim arises during or after the termination of this EULA. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING INTO THIS EULA, YOU AND TUNEIN ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION AND THAT THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE SUBJECT TO AND GOVERNED BY THE FEDERAL ARBITRATION ACT.</p>
                <p><b>b. Exceptions.</b> Notwithstanding Section 10.a above, nothing in this EULA will be deemed to waive, preclude or otherwise limit the right of either party to: (i) bring an individual action in small claims court; (ii) pursue an enforcement action through the applicable federal, state or local agency if that action is available; (iii) seek injunctive relief in aid of arbitration from a court of competent jurisdiction; or (iv) to file suit in a court of law to address an intellectual property infringement claim.</p>
                <p><b>c. Arbitrator.</b> Any arbitration between you and TuneIn will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act and the Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “<b>AAA Rules</b>”) of the American Arbitration Association (“<b>AAA</b>”), as modified by this EULA, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing forms are available online at <a href="https://www.adr.org">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by contacting TuneIn. The arbitrator has exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability or enforceability of this binding arbitration agreement.</p>
                <p><b>d. Notice; Process.</b> A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice of the dispute to the other party by U.S. Mail (“<b>Notice</b>”) or, if a postal address is not available, to the last known email address for such party. TuneIn’s address for Notice is: 210 King Street, 3rd Floor, San Francisco, CA 94107, Attn: Legal Department. The Notice must: (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought (“<b>Demand</b>”). The parties will make good faith efforts to resolve the claim directly, but if the parties do not reach an agreement to do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or TuneIn may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by you or TuneIn must not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and award, if any. If the dispute is finally resolved through arbitration in your favor with a monetary award that exceeds the last written settlement amount offered by TuneIn prior to selection of an arbitrator, then TuneIn will pay you the highest of the following: (A) the amount awarded by the arbitrator, if any; (B) the last written settlement amount offered by TuneIn in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s award; or (C) $15,000. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, the arbitrator can award injunctive relief as a remedy in any arbitration arising under this Section 10.</p>
                <p><b>e. Fees.</b> If you commence arbitration in accordance with this EULA, then TuneIn will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee, unless your claim is for more than $15,000 or as set forth below, in which case the payment of any fees will be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration hearing will take place at a location to be agreed upon in San Francisco, California, but if the claim is for $15,000 or less, you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted: (i) solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a non-appearance based telephone hearing; or (iii) by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that case, you agree to reimburse TuneIn for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator must issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision and award, if any, are based. Each party agrees that such written decision, and information exchanged during arbitration, will be kept confidential except to the extent necessary to enforce or permit limited judicial review of the award. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.</p>
                <p><b>f. No Class Actions.</b> YOU AND TUNEIN AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and TuneIn agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding.</p>
                <p><b>g. Modifications to this Arbitration Provision.</b> Except as otherwise provided in this EULA, if TuneIn makes any future change to this arbitration provision, other than a change to TuneIn’s address for Notice, then you may reject the change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to TuneIn’s address for Notice, in which case this arbitration provision, as in effect immediately prior to the changes you rejected, will continue to govern any disputes between you and TuneIn.</p>
                <p><b>h. Enforceability.</b> If Section 10.f above is found to be unenforceable or if the entirety of this Section 10 is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this Section 10 will be null and void.</p>
